If $R$ is a commutative ring (with 1) 
and $G$ is a group, then one defines the group ring $R[G]$. More precisely,
$R[G]$ is the set of finite linear combinations
\[
    \sum_{g\in G}\lambda_gg
\]
where $\lambda_g\in R$ and $\lambda_g=0$ for all but finitely many $g\in G$. 
One easily proves that $R[G]$ is a ring with 
addition
\[
\left(\sum_{g\in G}\lambda_gg\right)+\left(\sum_{g\in G}\mu_gg\right)
=\sum_{g\in G}(\lambda_g+\mu_g)(g)
\]
and multiplication 
\[
\left(\sum_{g\in G}\lambda_gg\right)\left(\sum_{h\in G}\mu_hh\right)
=\sum_{g,h\in G}\lambda_g\mu_h(gh).
\]
Moreover, $R[G]$ is a left $R$-module with
\[
\lambda(\sum_{g\in G}\lambda_gg)=\sum_{g\in G}(\lambda\lambda_g)g.
\]

\begin{exercise}
    Let $G$ be a group. Prove that if 
    $\Z[G]\simeq\Z[H]$, then $R[G]\simeq R[H]$ for any commutative ring $R$.      
\end{exercise}

\begin{question}[The isomorphism problem]
\index{Isomorphism problem}
\label{question:IP}
    Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. Does $\Z[G]\simeq\Z[H]$ imply $G\simeq H$?
\end{question}   

Although there are several cases where 
the isomorphism problem has an affirmative answer (e.g. abelian groups, 
metabelian groups, nilpotent groups, nilpotent-by-abelian groups, simple groups, 
abelian-by-nilpotent groups), it is false in general. In~\cite{MR1847590},    
Hertweck found a counterexample of order $2^{21}97^{28}$.

\begin{question}[The modular isomorphism problem]
\label{question:MIP}
\index{Modular isomorphism problem}
    Let $p$ be a prime number. Let 
    $G$ and $H$ be finite $p$-groups and let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p$. 
    Does $K[G]\simeq K[H]$ imply $G\simeq H$?
\end{question}   

Question \ref{question:MIP} has an affirmative answer in several cases. However, 
this is not true in general. This question was recently answered by Garc\'ia, Margolis and
del R\'io \cite{MR4373245}. They found two non-isomorphic groups $G$ and $H$ both of order $512$ 
such that $K[G]\simeq K[H]$ for all field $K$ 
of characteristic two.
