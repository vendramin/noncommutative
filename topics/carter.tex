\begin{definition}
    \index{Carter subgroup}
    Let $G$ be a finite group. A \textbf{Carter subgroup} of $G$ 
    is a nilpotent subgroup $C$ of $G$ such that 
    $C=N_G(C)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Carter]
    \index{Carter's theorem}
    \label{thm:Carter}
    Every finite solvable group has a Carter subgroup. Moreover, 
    every two Carter subgroups are conjugate. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    See \cite{MR0123603}. 
\end{proof}

Note that solvability is a needed assumption. For example, the
group $\Alt_5$ does not have Carter subgroups. 

\begin{exercise}
    Let $G$ be a finite solvable group and $C$ be a Carter subgroup. Let $N$ be a normal
    subgroup of $G$ such that $G/N$ is nilpotent. Prove that $NC=G$. 
\end{exercise}

Vdovin showed that even 
if a finite group is not solvable then any two Carter subgroups are conjugate. The proof is difficult and uses the classification of finite simple groups.
